//disjoint_set data structure
//imagine there are two garph 1-2-3-4 and 5-6-7 an you want to chek if 1 and 5 lies in same somponent
//you use bfs or dfs an theyw ill tell you no in time coleity O(n+e)->brute force linear time comp
//but disjoint_set say i will yel you eys or no in constand time peroid damn dude you must be fast
//ususlayy used in dynamic graphs -> graphs which usually keep on changing thier configuration
//primaty funtion: find patent() and union()(two way to implement rank and size)
